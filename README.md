# Media Player Controls
Maybe at some point a replacement for SpotifyControls, for now only works on Linux

This Media Player Controls plugin is very inspired (based on) the Spotify Controls plugin, so most of the credit goes to them.

For now, I have only tested it to work with the Strawberry media player on Linux.\
Theoretically it should work with Elisa and Amarok, and any other local media player can easily be added.\
In the future I might add support for other media players and platforms as well.\
I probably won't be adding this to VCS until I do plan on working on those features though.

# DISCLAIMER
This plugin currently only supports the `playerctl` interface. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL `playerctl` ON YOUR SYSTEM.\
To my knowledge, `playerctl` is only supported on Linux (and possibly MacOS with some workarounds).
The plugin is also somewhat early into development, so expect bugs. Feel free to open an issue or pull request.

# Installation
