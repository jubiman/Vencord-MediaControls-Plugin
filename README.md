# Media Player Controls
Maybe at some point a replacement for SpotifyControls, for now only works on Linux

This Media Player Controls plugin is very inspired (based on) the Spotify Controls plugin, so most of the credit goes to them.
At some point it would be nice to merge these plugins (especially since they are incompatible with each other)

For now, I have only tested it to work with the Strawberry media player on Linux.\
Theoretically it should work with any other local media player, which can easily be added in the settings.\
In the future I might add out-of-box support for other media players and platforms as well.

### DO NOT USE SPOTIFY CONTROLS AND THIS PLUGIN AT THE SAME TIME
To put it simply: the way this plugin and Spotify Controls render the modal is exactly the same, and thus mutually exclusive.
I don't think I will be trying to find a fix for this, as merging the two plugins would be a much better solution.

# DISCLAIMER
This plugin currently only supports the `playerctl` interface. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL `playerctl` ON YOUR SYSTEM.\
To my knowledge, `playerctl` is only supported on Linux (and possibly MacOS with some workarounds).
The plugin is also somewhat early into development, so expect bugs. Feel free to open an issue or pull request.


# Installation
